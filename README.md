`binfence` audits compiled release assets (PE, ELF, Mach-O) in CI/CD before they hit production. It guards against accidental compiler or linker regressions that strip exploit mitigations, violate `W^X` memory protection, corrupt Authenticode digests, or inject abnormal entropy.

* **[`binlens`](https://github.com/raidshadowmc-sudo/binlens)** is the underlying binary inspection and analysis engine. Use it for interactive debugging, manual triage, and detailed binary forensics.
* **`binfence`** builds on top of `binlens` to enforce release security policies in CI/CD pipelines, blocking releases that degrade exploit mitigations or violate `W^X`.

---

## Why binfence?

Linter and dependency checkers (`cargo audit`, `npm audit`, CodeQL) audit source code and dependency lockfiles. **Almost nobody audits the compiled binary artifact itself.**

A routine dependency bump or toolchain update can silently:
* Drop **ASLR / PIE** layout randomization.
* Disable **DEP / NX** stack protection.
* Introduce simultaneously writable and executable (**RWX**) sections violating `W^X`.
* Invalidate or tamper with **Authenticode** signatures post-build.
* Inflate Shannon entropy through unexpected packing or crypto payloads.

`binfence` acts as the final gate between your build pipeline and your GitHub Releases.

## GitHub Action Usage

Add `binfence` to your build or release workflow:

```yaml
name: Release Gate

on:
  release:
    types: [published]
  push:
    tags: ['v*']

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write

jobs:
  audit-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build production binary
        run: cargo build --release

      - name: Run Binary Release Gate
        uses: raidshadowmc-sudo/binfence@v0.1.3
        with:
          binary: target/release/my_app
          fail-on-degraded: true
          fail-on-rwx: true
          require-aslr: true
          require-dep: true

      - name: Upload SARIF to GitHub Security tab
        if: always()
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: binfence.sarif
```

### Comparing Against Baseline (Differential Gate)

To catch regressions between consecutive releases:

```yaml
- name: Download Previous Release Asset
  run: gh release download v1.0.0 --pattern "my_app" --output old_app
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}

- name: Audit Against Baseline
  uses: raidshadowmc-sudo/binfence@v0.1.3
  with:
    binary: target/release/my_app
    baseline: old_app
    fail-on-degraded: true
```

## GitHub Step Summary Output

`binfence` automatically posts a rich Markdown table into `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`:

```markdown
### 🟢 Binfence Security Gate: PASSED

## Security Rules Evaluated

| Rule ID | Name | Severity | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `BIN001-*` | `SecurityMitigationDegraded` | 🔴 Error | An enabled mitigation (`ASLR`, `DEP`, `CFG`, `RELRO`, `Canary`, `FORTIFY`, `SafeSEH`) was dropped compared to baseline. |
| `BIN002-NO-ASLR` | `RequireASLR` | 🔴 Error | Binary was linked without dynamic base or position-independent executable (PIE) support. |
| `BIN003-NO-DEP` | `RequireDEP` | 🔴 Error | Binary does not enforce non-executable stack/heap protection (`NX_COMPAT` or `PT_GNU_STACK`). |
| `BIN004-RWX-SECTION` | `DisallowRWXSections` | 🔴 Error | Binary contains simultaneously writable and executable sections (`W^X` violation). |
